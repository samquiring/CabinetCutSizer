Reasoning:

  This program is intended to help my Father who is a general contractor which entails cabinet making. The material used is quite expensive
so often times creating a "rip sheet" is a time consuming and stressful proccess. It entails looking at all the measurements taken on the
job and finding the best way to cut 4x8 sheets of wood to create the least amount of needed cuts and while also having the least amount of waste.

How to use:

1. Organize all Cuts neatly into an excel file and put each different type of wood and/or different 
   thickness of wood into different excel sheets. See example.xls for example of what this should look
   like
2. create a blank output excel file that the rips can be written onto or use an existing file
   (your previous sheets on the file will not be overwritten)
3. Download Python 3.x
4. Download both .py files
5. open up terminal
6. install tkinter, pandas, and numpy
7. Run CabinetCutGUI.py
8. Select your input, then output, then click run
9. view your output file. The number in the 1st row is the rip size and the numbers below are the cuts to make on that specific rip
10. Cut the wood!
